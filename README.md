# E2_ergodicity

Enormous thanks to Louis Dressel for his ErgodicControl.jl (https://github.com/dressel/ErgodicControl.jl).  

This is a C implementation intended for use with embedded systems, as such, utility is drastically reduced.

(Will stick everything in proper files when I figure out how it fits with RPERTs)
